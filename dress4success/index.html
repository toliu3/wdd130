                <p>Mr. Liu Wanlai is an enthusiastic collector of genealogy. In a gathering in February 1967, Liu Wanlai proposed to write the Liu family tree and build an ancestral hall to commemorate the ancestors. After everyone agreed, Liu Wanlai, Liu Yishou, and Liu Mingjiao were recommended to be responsible for the construction work and organize the preparatory committee. The ground was broken in August 1967 through the enthusiastic donations of many clan relatives, and the construction was completed in March 1968. The address is located in Huayuanli, Guanmiao District, Tainan City.

                <p>The purpose of this ancestral hall is to commemorate the ancestors who came to Taiwan from mainland China in the early 18th century and to remember the spirit of hardship and adventure of the ancestors. At the same time, it also commemorates the ancestors who lived here. Use this ancestral hall to let the clan members understand the deeds of their ancestors, and at the same time, it can also connect the feelings of clan relatives from all over the world.
