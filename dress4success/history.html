                <p>The ancestor Liu Wanxing was born on April 24, 1707. He originally lived in Tangyuan Society, Tong'an County, Quanzhou Prefecture, Fujian Province, China, and lived in 19 Duxiangzikou, Horseshoe Society (about now Longhai District, Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, China). In the early 18th century, it was still fully dangerous to travel to Taiwan from mainland China by boat across the Taiwan Strait. People often drowned in the sea by accident. Because of the family's financial difficulties, after his parents passed away, he went to Taiwan with Liu Yuan and Liu Wande from his hometown to find a new world. In the end, he stayed in Guanmiao, Tainan to reclaim the wasteland and make a living by farming.

                <p>When he came to Taiwan from mainland China, he still carried his parents' Tablets with him. The deeds of these ancestors, the address of his hometown, and the genealogy are also engraved on the wall of Liu's ancestral hall. The Ancestral Tablets that he brought from mainland China are still displayed in the ancestral hall.
