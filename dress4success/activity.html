                <p>Since Mr. Liu Wanxing, the first ancestor who came to Taiwan, was born on March 22 of the lunar calendar, in the past, the ancestral hall of the Liu surname used March 22 of the lunar calendar every year as a day for the Liu surname clan to gather and commemorate the ancestors. Due to social changes, in order to facilitate clan gatherings, the current date of commemoration has been changed to the Saturday before March 22 in the lunar calendar. The commemoration ceremony will start at 10:00 in the morning, and the clan will gather together in the evening for a meal. In a year, this has become the most important activity of the Liu ancestral hall. During the dinner, the management committee will also award scholarships to students with excellent grades in the clan to encourage children to study hard at school.

                <p>The ancestral hall established a management committee in 1967. The first chairman was Liu Wanlai, the second chairman was Liu Qizuo, the third chairman was Liu Hetian, and now the fourth chairman is Liu Jianming.
                </p>
                <p>Liu Wanlai collected the family tree and compiled a family tree of the Liu surname, which was published in 1993. All genealogical information has been stored on the FamilySearch website, and interested people can visit the website for inquiries.
